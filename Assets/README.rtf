\f0\fs24 \cf0 Features:  Unlock 4 moves by 3rd battle, first move has 100% hit rate and does 1 damage, 2nd move has 50% hit rate but does 3 damage, 3rd move has 80% hit rate and does status effect damage (affected player loses 1 HP every turn) and 4th move is unique to player class (i.e. warrior has fatal blow which has a 30% chance of hitting but instantly defeats opponent).  Added in blocking, encouraging player, and healing moves for added complexity.  Some enemy AI implemented (i.e. will heal when the enemy has less than half HP, will block if the players are not attackable).  Sound effects when attacks occur.\
Each battle becomes more difficult with more moves for added complexity, more damage dealt and received (1 more each battle) and the enemy types are set to disadvantage the player making strategy more difficult.  Dialogue is unique and done in a tree fashion so the partner character will respond accordingly to a positive/negative dialogue choice.  Player and partner determined by personality quiz.\
\
Known bugs:\
If the quiz buttons are clicked too quickly, an out of bounds error is throw (not game breaking)\
\
Potential bugs: \
Damage calculations should be correct, but could potentially not be correct with added moves in the third battle.  Effect damage takes place at the beginning of the player turn which can look odd but should be done correctly. Final screen button may not restart game\
